# Algo-Practice

## Background
This repository comprises algorithm challenges and solutions, along with data structure foundations broken down into my own language in order to create a deeper understanding of algorithmic structure and problem-solving methods.

All coding solutions are written in JavaScript. Unit tests created using Mocha/Chai along with nyc npm package for test coverage.
